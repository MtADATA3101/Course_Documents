Choose a retracted article from the Retraction Watch Database (http://retractionwatchdatabase.org), using the filter “Concerns about data” or “Error in data” or “Unreliable data”
Note: examples that don’t include falsified data are usually more interesting!
Read the Retraction Watch blog article (if available), and the retraction notice (if available)
In your own words, write a description of the problem with the data. Which step of the research data lifecycle would you identify as the place where these researchers had problems?

In your RStudio project (linked to your MtADATA3101 repository)
Go to File – New File – R Markdown
Give the file a human readable filename (can have spaces here)
Add the text you created in Part 1 to the bottom of the bottom of the default text
Save with a machine-readable filename (no spaces!)
Go to Settings – Output Options – Advanced
Check ”Keep markdown source file”
Knit 
In the Git pane, stage the new folder, commit, and push

Goals for this assignment: identifying data problems in published scholarship, understanding where researchers could improve their research data management, testing GitHub repository setup
